abstract = {The fundamental electrical limits of MOSFETs are discussed and modeled to predict the scaling limits of digital bulk CMOS circuits. Limits discussed include subthreshold currents, time depen-dent dielectric breakdown TDDB, hot electron eeects, and drain induced barrier lowering DIBL. This paper predicts the scaling of bulk CMOS MOSFETs to reach its limits at drawn dimensions of approximately 0:1m. These electrical limits are used to scaling factors for SPICE Level 3 model parameters, and a scalable Level 3 device model is presented. Current trends in scaling interconnects are also discussed.},
